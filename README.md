# Miles Test Project
- Run the command flutter pub get, and for iOS, cd ios and run pod install.
- I have used GetX for state management and GoRouter for routing.
- The Core folder includes essential project files such as constants, routes, enum, typography, and     size configuration.
- The Modules folder contains the UI, Controller, and widgets.
- The YouTube player is integrated into two sections: Reels and Inshorts.
- Currently, I have not added a connectivity checker for internet connection. However, I have implemented permission checks.
